Add per-type option for non-owner teleport mode and for owner teleport mode
0: normal
1: cannot teleport into
2: cannot teleport out of
3: cannot teleport into or out of (but can teleport while inside)
4: cannot teleport into, out of, or while inside

Add per-type option for entity removal mode
0: none
1: banish (delete; no items drop)
2: push outwards
3: kill
4: teleport outside, face away from center, and reset ai (make sure not to teleport into another protected zone, and to match block type, eg. if it was in water, put it in water, if possible)

Does block protection method work for fire?
